# Hack-a-thing 1: Unity-2D

I attempted to build a 2D RPG game in Unity through [this tutorial](https://learn.unity.com/project/creator-kit-rpg?uv=2020.3) and [this Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-unity3d/learn/lecture/27600026#content). These tutorials taught me how to install Unity, tips and tricks for unity, and how to create an actual Unity game. 

## What I learned
First, I learned concepts surrounding game development in general, such as tilemapping, objects, cameras, and lighting. The Udemy course taught 3D basics, so I learned about how to include gravity, change the lighting and camera of the scene, and set up my environment for 3D development. Then, in the 2D tutorial, I learned first how to create tilemaps for the background, midground, fences, and foreground. Then, I learned how to implement an inventory, create quests, make NPCs, add soundbytes, and create storyline texts. 

## What didn't work
3D development was quite difficult. I also didn't learn enough C# from this experience, and that is something that would offer me more control over game development. I also learned how much design goes into game development, which was a bit discouraging, because it means that it will be more difficult for me to make a game by myself in the future (outside of CS 98!).
